# Setup

In order to start with OSS Lightning Web Components, follow these steps (which can also be found on the LWR OSS website [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lwr/guide/lwr-get-started.html)):

-   Run `npm init lwr@latest`
-   Pick a name for your project
-   Accept the generated package name by pressing the **Enter** key
-   For **Select a type of project**, accept the default, _Static Site_
    -   We can also choose a single-page app, but _Static Site_ is easier to start with
-   For **Select a variant**, accept the default, _Markdown Static Site_
    -   This is also the only option

You will also want to run the following commands to set up the project:

```bash
cd ProjectName
npm install
```

You can also use `npm run dev` in order to deploy the dev build of the site.
